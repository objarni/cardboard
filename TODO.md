# TODO list

- style the red box with a border, rounded corners
- take our model and make a 'Card' type so we can loop over them and paint them in the view
- write some unit tests just so we can learn the syntax
- card doesn't move unless you click on it
- cards that are currently being moved are styled differently - with shadow
