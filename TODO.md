# TODO list

## Potential App improvements
- Seeing multiple cards, even if only one
  card is move:able would take us closer to
  a realistic looking board
- The shadow is red and looks unrealistic
- When grabbing a card, it does not look
  as if it is 'lifted' because it stays at
  the exact same location as when it was on
  table. Offset slightly?
- Animating lifting/releasing cards would look
  sweet!
- Being able to add/remove cards one by one
- Being able to bulk add cards via copy-paste
  of text
- Ability to not only have texts, but images
  as cards
- Ability to specify width of cards
- Ability to specify url (or generate) so as to
  spread the 'board' to others for collaboration


## Potential Code/Development ux improvements
- Continuously: fix one of the TODOs in code
- CardState maybe not needed at all?
- Write some unit tests just so we can learn the 
syntax
- Learning about regression testing elm applications
  would be great (elm-program-test is popular)
- Parcel is supposedly more cross platform than
  elm-live (which has some issues in Windows?) so
  would improve the mobs hot-reloading experience
- Refactor Model from Main.elm into Model.elm.
- Promote Model to a "real type" (not only alias).
