# TODO list

- Move cards relative to initial position (avoid snapping card to upper left corner)
- Write some unit tests just so we can learn the syntax
- Implement cards that are currently being moved are styled differently - with shadow
- Hardcode more cards and render them
- Refactor card to its own proper type (and file)
- CardState maybe not needed at all?
